## Features

| Area            | Capabilities                                                                                       |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Commands**    | Built-ins (`cd`, `echo`, `exit`, `history`, `pwd`, `type`) and external programs from `PATH`       |
| **Editing**     | Arrow keys (←/→), backspace, insert at cursor; full line redraw keeps display in sync              |
| **History**     | Persistent history via `HISTFILE`; ↑/↓ to navigate; `history` built-in with `-c`, `-r`, `-w`, `-a` |
| **Completion**  | Tab completion for executables and paths; LCP when multiple matches; list on second Tab            |
| **Pipelines**   | Chain commands with `                                                                              | ` (pipe) |
| **Redirection** | `>`, `>>`, `2>`, `2>>`, `&>`, `&>>` for stdout/stderr                                              |
| **Signals**     | Ctrl+C clears line; Ctrl+D exits if line empty, else shows completions                             |

- **Executable resolution**: Only files with execute permission (or Windows equivalents) are considered when resolving commands from `PATH`.
- **Longest common prefix**: When several completions share a prefix longer than the current token, the shell completes to that prefix; trailing `/` or space is added only for a single match.

./your_program.sh
```
